*What is an CNN* : **Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns feature engineering by itself via filters (or kernel) optimization.**

- This project is part of my training in artificial intelligence and in using the pytorch library. 

- In this project we're trying to classify images into 4 different categories using a CNN that we're going to implement. We will try out different types of optimiser in order to evaluate their performance. We will then increase the size of our dataset to make our model even more efficient.
